Summary. A Simple Note Taker, with Windows XP Styling
Users can use CRUD for different kinds of text files, which dictate the editability and the view that renders when you open a file.

Extra Validations and CRUD Functionality will be in the Users table, with an option after making the account to add a custom Image,
Change your Username/Password, and extra Requirements that the First and the Last account Must be an Administrator. 

Files will have name, text, file_type, and is_shared values that the user can edit. Name is Required and File Type are required, IsShared is Boolean,
 though all the stats will be Visible in the file's "update" page. ("Properties")

All Users Can see all Shared Files, Only Administrators can Edit/Delete Shared Files that aren't their own.


Update and Delete for Users, First/Last user MUST be Administrator.

Views: 
	Login/Registration: 
	Logins will be listed on the side, you will have so select your Username from a list, rather than type it in. 
	
	All Pages: Standard Background, When You click the "Task Bar", it opens up a turns on a "logout" <div>, that Displays your Name and Profile Picture.
	This will be in the place of a standard Header.
	
	Home: 
	Lists Other Views: "Edit Users", "Shared Files", My Files" Each Button Requires Double Click.
	

	Edit Users: List with at least RUD for Users, (Bonus to myself to also have 2nd Create form here.) 
	This is where you get the option to upload an image, an admin account can change other user's info, and make them admins as well.
	If Deleting Users, Last User Must be an Admin, If You delete Yourself, You will be logged Out.
	(A newly Created User can be created as an admin, so you don't get stuck with no administrators.)
	
	Shared files: a List of All files where IsShared == True, Only Admins can delete files that they did not create.

	My Files: A List of only the logged in user's files Also has a button to create a new file. (I might try and make this a Right-Click)
	You Select the File Type and Name when this button is hit. To change the "Data" you have to "open" The File.

	File: get one file, Opens a single File and has Edit Functionality for Data, Name, and IsShared.
	File will have different views depending on the File Type of Text, Richtext, or PDF
	Bonus To Me - Can't edit PDF, but you can change another file to it.

	Properties: Lets You Change Name, File Type, and Is Shared, Delete Button. Also Lists Created at, Updated at, and creator. 
	Only Admins can access Properties for Files that aren't theirs, From the Shared Files window.
